## How command work?
# /arpg

/arpg exp/levels/points add/get 'Player' - adding and getting exp/levels/points to player

/arpg multiplier - multiplying amount of exp that you get from walking/breaking/attacking/taking damage

## Why scale is only by these buttons on top left?

Because not everyone wants to be small or big.
