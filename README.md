## How command work?
# /arpg

/arpg exp/levels/points add/get 'Player' - adding and getting exp/levels/points to player

/arpg multiplier - multiplying amount of exp that you get from walking/breaking/attacking/taking damage

/arpg stat - setting stats to value. Different stats have different default value, so for example to set health, you need to add or remove needed value from 20, or attack, you need to add or remove from 1. All default value will be lower.

default values:
- Health - 20
- Attack - 1
- Movement - 0.1
- Mining - 1
- Resistance - 0

## Why scale is only by these buttons on top left?

Because not everyone wants to be small or big.
